Project addressed in the course of “Software Engineering 2” at Politecnico di Milano in 2016/2017 course year, in which we had to develop a digital management system for a car-sharing service that exclusively employs electric cars.

All the information about the documents which we had to compose for this digital management system can be found in the PDF: "Assignments AA 2016-2017.pdf"

Since we were not asked to implement this system in code, we were also assigned to perform an additional code inspection on a selected code extract from a release of the Apache OFBiz project, which is an open source product for the automation of enterprise processes. The description related to this task can be found in the PDF: “Code Inspection Assignment Task Description.pdf”
